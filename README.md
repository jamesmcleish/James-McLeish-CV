## Work Experience

#### NanoFlex (June 2022 - December 2022)  
Co-founder and CEO

- As a company we were invited to a start-up accelerator in Boston to compete for $1,000,000 in funding.
- Generated revenue by matching clients from either side of the business, small social media users and small to medium size enterprises.
- I handled finances, strategy, project managing our developers, and administration.
- Project managed the launching of our web-application.( https://www.nanoflex.uk/ )

## Skills

#### Communication
I pitched my company against 50,000 applicants to achieve a spot in an accelerator based in Boston that was made up of 28 participants. While there I continued to pitch the company to people in the VC community and to successful founders. I recieved a lot of feedback and was able to effectively use it to improve our company.

#### Process Based work for solving problems
I completed a degree in mathematics. This required a lot of patience and a strong approach to problem solving. It taught me to break down larger problems into smaller ones and to think about different possible approaches to a solution before jumping in. I believe this has helped me get into a good software developer mindset from early on.
